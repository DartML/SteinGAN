# SteinGAN
This repository contains the code for the paper [Learning to Draw Samples: With Application to Amortized MLE for Generative Adversarial Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01722.pdf).

The code is based on the excellent implementation of [DCGAN](https://github.com/Newmu/dcgan_code).

## MNIST
We evaluate our methods on MNIST and
use a simple Gaussian-Bernoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machines
(RBM) as our energy-based model, which allows
us to accurately evaluate the test likelihood.
SteinGAN without the kernel
tends to produce much less diverse images. This suggests
that the repulsive term is responsible for generating diverse
images in SteinGAN.
